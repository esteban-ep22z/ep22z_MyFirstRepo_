**What did you learn?** 

I learned different text styling, uploading urls, making files on git hub and making repositories. 

**What did you find confusing?**
At first I tried to do the repository in vscode, but it was easier to do it on the github website. I still want to see videoes on how to use the github desktop. I also found using the uv command quite challenging. AS disccused in class, learning how to work in the liabries would make this type of assignments much easier. I still am confused on branching.
